# Halo
Web Scraper for Bungie stats disapearing on Feb 9

Everything is in R

Will be updated in pieces. There will be a code to set up the folders that will be used by subsequent codes.

In general, you provide a gamertag and it will scrape your stats from Bungie's website.

For Halo 3 (first game), I am thinking 3 files for multiplayer: One for summary stats by map/gametype, one for heatmaps, and one for game summaries for every multiplayer game played.

Initial focus is just on scraping, with follow up codes for cleaning and visualization.

Current codes:
H3 Multiplayer Scraper
H3 Custom Game Scraper
H3 Heatmap Scraper
